# Icons Directory

This directory contains custom SVG icons and other graphical assets for the application.

## Usage

Since we're using `lucide-react` for most icons, custom icons should be placed here only when needed.

Example custom icon usage:
```jsx
import CustomIcon from '../assets/icons/custom-icon.svg';

<img src={CustomIcon} alt="Custom Icon" className="w-6 h-6" />
```

## Available Lucide Icons
