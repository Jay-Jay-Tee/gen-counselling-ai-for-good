# Gen Counselling AI for Good 🧬💙  
*A web-based AI preventive health platform for inherited disease risk awareness.*

---

## 📌 Project Gist (Brief)

We are building a web-based AI preventive health platform that predicts an individual’s genetically inherited disease risks using:

- **Family history (up to 2 generations)**
- **User health records** (manual input / AI-OCR)
- **Open-source datasets**

The system displays **disease-wise risk** as ranked probabilities or risk classes (**I–IV**), explains each condition in simple language, and functions as a **dynamic health coach** by suggesting lifestyle interventions, recommended screening tests, and urgent doctor consultation when risk is high.

The goal is to reduce late diagnosis and improve early awareness among adolescents and adults.

---

## 1) 🧩 Problem Statement

Many individuals unknowingly carry a genetic predisposition to chronic and inherited diseases such as:

- Type-2 diabetes  
- Coronary artery disease  
- Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA-related)  
- Thalassemia  
- Sickle cell disease  
- Familial hypercholesterolemia  

These risks remain invisible until symptoms appear, leading to delayed diagnosis and worse outcomes. Adolescents and young adults especially rarely undergo preventive screening or risk assessment, missing early intervention opportunities.

Existing healthcare systems largely react after disease onset rather than predicting and preventing it, increasing long-term health burden, healthcare costs, and avoidable morbidity.

---

## 2) 🌍 Context and Persistence of the Problem

This issue is widespread across both urban and semi-urban populations, especially in countries like India where preventive healthcare adoption is low.

It impacts individuals with family histories of chronic or inherited disease, many of whom remain unaware of their genetic risk. Despite medical advances, genetic testing and counseling still remain:

- expensive
- inaccessible
- poorly integrated into routine care

Healthcare systems largely focus on treatment rather than prediction. Asymptomatic individuals rarely seek screening, allowing inherited risks to go unnoticed and increasing preventable complications and long-term burden.

---

## 3) 🎯 Target Users / Beneficiaries or Community

**Primary users:**
- Adolescents and adults (**15–55 years**) who are asymptomatic but may carry inherited risk
- Students, working professionals, and middle-aged individuals in urban and semi-urban regions with limited access to preventive healthcare

**Secondary beneficiaries:**
- Families with known inherited medical histories who seek early screening and awareness

This solution is especially relevant for individuals who cannot afford routine genetic testing but have access to smartphones and basic medical records.

---

## 4) 😣 User Needs and Pain Points

Users often:
- lack awareness of inherited disease risks
- don’t understand how family history affects personal health outcomes
- face high costs of genetic testing
- lack structured preventive guidance
- feel confused about when/what screening tests to take
- don’t know what symptoms require urgency

Healthcare support is often reactive and fragmented. There is a large gap between:
> knowing a disease exists in the family  
and  
> knowing how lifestyle and preventive actions can reduce risk

This leads to anxiety, neglect, and delayed diagnosis of manageable conditions.

---

## 5) 🌱 Long-Term Impact

In the long run, this solution can shift healthcare from **reactive treatment** to **preventive decision-making**.

Early awareness of genetic risk enables:
- timely screening
- lifestyle modification
- faster diagnosis and intervention

This reduces disease severity and healthcare costs, while empowering youth to take ownership of health before symptoms appear.

At scale, the system can reduce the burden of chronic and inherited diseases and promote a stronger preventive health culture.

---

## 6) 🔍 What Informed Our Understanding of the Problem

Our understanding was shaped by:
- real-world observation of delayed diagnosis in hereditary conditions like Type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease
- a case where a peer developed diabetes without prior risk awareness despite strong family history
- discussions with affected families
- secondary research highlighting gaps in preventive healthcare and risk stratification
- academic exposure to health data analysis showing family history and lifestyle indicators are underused in early prediction

We observed that asymptomatic individuals—especially youth—rarely seek screening, missing early preventive opportunities.

## 7) ♻️ Relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)

✅ **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being**

---

## 8) 🧠 Proposed Direction of the Solution

We are exploring a web-based preventive health platform that collects:

- user health records
- family medical history (up to two generations)

via manual input or AI-powered OCR.

Using open-source health datasets, AI models estimate risk for multiple inherited diseases and display them as:

- ranked probabilities  
or  
- categorized risk classes (**I–IV**)

For each disease, the system generates:
- simple disease summaries
- personalized prevention advice
- screening / confirmatory test recommendations
- alerts for high-risk users encouraging timely doctor consultation

The platform functions as a dynamic health coach enabling continuous risk awareness and proactive prevention rather than one-time diagnosis.

---

## 9) 🤖 Role of AI in Our Approach

AI enables scalable and personalized genetic risk awareness by turning fragmented health records, family history, and lifestyle data into actionable risk insights.

Key AI roles include:
- **AI OCR** to digitize unstructured medical documents
- **pattern-learning ML models** to infer predisposition from population datasets
- **risk stratification** converting probabilities into risk classes (I–IV)
- **adaptive recommendation engine** that updates prevention advice based on user inputs

This reduces dependence on expensive one-time genetic testing while supporting early decision-making through prevention-first guidance.

---

## ✅ SDG Impact Summary

This system supports:
- early risk awareness
- preventive screening
- accessible health literacy
- reduced late-stage disease complications  
→ directly contributing to **SDG 3: Good Health & Well-Being**

---

## 📌 Notes

⚠️ This platform is intended as a **preventive decision-support tool**, not a replacement for licensed medical diagnosis. High-risk outputs always recommend professional medical consultation.
